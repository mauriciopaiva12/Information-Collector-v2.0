# Information-Collector-v2.0
 
<p>

__*Project dedicated to collecting information in the first stages of a Pentest.<br />
The project is not yet finished, as I am evolving it as I have time, so it will receive several updates yet.*__

<p>

## Required libraries and installations

<p>

Some libraries are needed, such as: socket, sys, time.<br />
To install them, just copy and paste the following codes into the terminal, remembering that each version of the pip corresponds to a version of python.<br />

<p>

---

### Installation

`pip3 install sockets`

## PortScan Category and Full Category

<p>
 
*Next, I'll talk a little bit about the categories, both the portscan category and the full category, I'll talk a little bit about how it works and about planning.*

</p>

---

### PortScan

<p>
 
Within the PortScan category it is possible to do two types of scans, one with the main ports, and the other complete.<br /><br />
The scan with the main doors presents both the open and closed doors of the desired target, but both are differentiated by color.<br />
In the full scan, it scans all the target's doors, but with a differential from the other, it presents only the open doors.

</p>

---

### Full Category

<p>

The complete category is not yet finalized, but soon I will start this part of the project.

<p>

---

### Planning

<p>
 
 Within the moment I will start the construction of the complete category, starting with the Brute Force DNS and bringing it to the repository as soon as possible.
